## Character-level GRU (Gate Reccurent Unit)

Course project on recurrent neural networks.

Given a sequence of characters, the objective is to predict the next character in the sequence. The code is written in Lua and requires [Torch](http://torch.ch/).

### Infos

*data.t7* and *vocab.t7* are data files used to train the model

Run the following command to play around with hyperparameters:
